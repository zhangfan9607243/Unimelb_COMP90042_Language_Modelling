# Language Modelling in Hangman

This project implements AI players for the Hangman game using various language models, from simple unigram approaches to advanced n-gram models. The goal is to minimize incorrect guesses by learning character patterns from text corpora.

## Contents

- `Language_Modelling_Hangman.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and analysis of different language models for Hangman AI.

## Features

- Dataset preparation from NLTK Brown corpus
- Random baseline guesser
- Unigram language model
- Length-conditioned unigram model
- Bigram language model
- Advanced trigram and combined models
- Performance evaluation and comparison
